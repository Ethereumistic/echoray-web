# Echoray.io Design Guidelines for AI Models

**Version:** 1.0  
**Scope:** Conceptual, Strategic, and Stylistic Guidelines  
**Target:** AI Models generating content, layouts, or strategies for Echoray.io

## 🛑 The Prime Directive

**Absolute Constraint:** When imagining, describing, or structuring interfaces for Echoray.io, you are strictly prohibited from inventing custom elements.

Think of the interface as a standardized construction kit. You are a master assembler, not a manufacturer. You do not forge new tools; you compose utilizing **shadcn/ui** exclusively. Every button, card, input, and modal must map directly to this pre-existing library. You must never describe or implement a "vanilla" solution when a library component exists.

## 🌊 Brand Philosophy: The Ocean Metaphor

To understand Echoray, you must understand our narrative soul. We are not just a web agency; we are a beacon in the deep.

### The Persona: Mr. Ray
We embody the spirit of **Mr. Ray** from *Finding Nemo*.
* **We are the Teacher:** We possess deep, technical knowledge of the "ocean" (the internet, Web2, Web3, infrastructure).
* **We are Protective:** We guide "young fish" (clients) away from "The Drop-off" (security threats, poor practices).
* **We are Clear:** We turn the terrifying complexity of the underwater world into a sing-along song. We make the complex simple.

### The Cast (Your Audience)
* **The Ocean:** The overwhelming digital ecosystem.
* **Dory:** The security-naive client. They reuse passwords and need our protection.
* **Nemo:** The curious explorer. They want to grow but might wander into danger without our guardrails.
* **Bruce:** The threat. Hackers and vulnerabilities that we silently defend against.

## 🎨 Visual Semantics

Do not think in hex codes; think in feelings and atmosphere.

### 1. The Atmosphere (Dark Mode)
Our default existence is deep underwater. The interface should feel immersive, sleek, and professional. It is dark, but not pitch black—think of the ocean depths where light still penetrates. This reduces eye strain and implies a modern, high-tech environment.

### 2. The Beacon (Electric Blue)
Our primary color is **Electric Blue**. It represents bio-luminescence in the dark. It is the color of trust, intelligence, and the signal that guides the user. Use this color sparingly to draw attention to the most critical actions (like a "Start Project" button) or active states. It should never overwhelm the eye; it should guide it.

### 3. Spatial Harmony
We value "professional breathing room."
* **Corners:** We avoid sharp, aggressive edges, but we also avoid overly bubbly, childish shapes. We sit in the "professional sweet spot"—softly rounded corners that suggest B2B reliability.
* **Spacing:** Do not clutter. Information should flow with a rhythm. Group related items tightly, but separate distinct sections with generous space to allow the user to process information.

## 🗣️ Voice and Tone

When writing copy or generating text for the interface, adhere to these four pillars:

1.  **Professional yet Approachable:** We are experts, but we are not ivory-tower academics. We are friendly guides.
2.  **Educational:** Explain *why* something is happening. If a user needs to enable 2FA, explain it's for their safety, not just a requirement.
3.  **Trustworthy:** We build enterprise systems. Our language must be stable, confident, and error-free. Avoid slang.
4.  **Forward-Thinking:** We bridge the gap between today's web and tomorrow's technology (Web3). Speak with an eye toward the future.

## 🏗️ Structural Philosophy

When organizing content, follow this hierarchy of thought:

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
Never sacrifice usability for a visual gimmick. The goal is to illuminate the digital landscape, not confuse the user with abstract navigation.

### 2. The "Shadcn" Mental Model
When structuring a page, mentally map every element to a specific component:
* Need a list of recent projects? **Think: Table.**
* Need to show a user profile? **Think: Avatar.**
* Need to hide complex details? **Think: Accordion or Collapsible.**
* Need a mobile menu? **Think: Sheet (Slide-out panel).**
* Need to alert the user? **Think: Toast (Notification) or Alert.**

### 3. Conversion Optimization
Every page has a job.
* **Primary Actions:** Must be obvious and use the primary "Electric Blue" styling.
* **Secondary Actions:** Must recede visually (outlines or ghost buttons) so they don't compete with the main goal.
* **Trust Signals:** Always look for opportunities to display social proof (badges, statistics, testimonials) within Cards.

## 🛡️ Accessibility and Inclusivity

Accessibility is not an afterthought; it is the foundation.
* **Structure:** Use proper headings to create a logical outline.
* **Labels:** Every form input must have a clear label.
* **Motion:** Animation should be subtle and purposeful (like a fish gliding), never jarring or flashing. We rely on the natural behavior of our interface components rather than forcing custom movement.

## 🧠 The AI Workflow Checklist

Before generating any output for Echoray.io, ask yourself:

1.  **Is this Mr. Ray speaking?** Is it helpful, clear, and protective?
2.  **Is this a standard part?** Am I trying to invent a new UI element, or am I using the established kit? (Always choose the kit).
3.  **Is the hierarchy clear?** Does the user know exactly what the most important action is?
4.  **Is it responsive?** Have I considered how this information stacks on a mobile device versus a desktop screen?

**Summary:** Be the beacon. Bring clarity to the complexity. Use the tools provided.
